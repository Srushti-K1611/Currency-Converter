*DESCRIPTION*:This program is a simple currency converter written in C++. It takes user input for the base currency, target currency, amount, and exchange rate. The program then multiplies the amount by the exchange rate to calculate the converted amount. It uses basic input (cin) and output (cout) functions to interact with the user. The conversion logic is placed inside a function called convertCurrency, which makes the code organized and reusable.
